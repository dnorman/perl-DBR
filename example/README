DBR Examples!

I've always found it best to learn by example, rather than reading through gobs of documentation as a first resort.
So here are some simple examples of how to use DBR.

Provided you have all the required dependencies installed, you should be able to run any of the example scripts here right out of the box.
If you are in doubt about this, please run the following to find out:
   cd .. ; perl Makefile.PL

Each example will use DBR::Sandbox to create a sqlite DBR environment in a bottle.
Sniff around the _sandbox directory and the generated_dbr.conf to get an idea of how things work.
