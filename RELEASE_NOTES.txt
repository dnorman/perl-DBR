= DBR 1.1 release notes =

Headliners:
 * $resultset->count can now be trusted! Always!
   It should always work now regardless of whether you have fetched any records or not.
 * Resultsets may now be refined!
   my $items = $order->items->where( status => 'active' ) # IS NOW POSSIBLE
   This is infinately chainable, because you may now call ->where on any resultset to get a sub-resultset.
   In fact, the above example only initiates one query of the items table per chunk of 1,000 order records.
   This resulted from a *major* remodel of the relationship code to implement lazy execution at the time of the first ->next, rather than ->where.
 * Table inserts now enforce the non-null status on fields.
   Any inserts into a table with one or more non-null fields will require that you provide a values for them.
   The only downside is that it does not respect database enforced default values.
   Some discussion of this one may be required prior to the final release of 1.1 as this may actually break some production code.
 * New! Batshit crazy AND / OR logic
   DBR::Util::Operator now exports AND and OR subroutines, with evil syntactic sugaryness.
   There is zero documentation on this right now, but the following sort of logic is now possible:
   {{{
my $resultset = $dbrh->tablename->where(
                                        ( status => 'active' )
					OR
                                        (
                                          status  => 'retired',
                                          thingus => GT 1,
                                        )
                                       );
   }}}
 * Probably other stuff I forgot about. lol

Some handy stuff: 
 * $dbrh->tablename->parse( somefield => 'somevalue' ) now works for all fields, regardless of whether they are translated fields or not.
   This does full type, range and regex checking. It's Very handy for data validation.
 * Added many new test cases
 * Totally re-arranged most of the modules. The file tree is starting to make a little more sense now.
 * Reverted dependency on File::Path to 1.08, because centos5 is stupid and cannot upgrade File::Path without totally repackaging perl itself.

Some stuff I heartlessly broke:
 * DBR::Config::Schema no longer contains a browse method.
   Sorry for being a bit heavy handed about removing this, but the former browse code belongs elsewhere.
   John: I'd be happy to discuss a better place for the code.

Some things that are '''Not''' included in 1.1:
 * DBR Admin overhaul
   I think I have a pretty good thing going on https://perl-dbr.googlecode.com/svn/branches/pre_1.1
   but I didn't want it to hold up the 1.1 release.
   I need help with finishing this! Volunteers would be much appreciated.
 * A proper exception handling system.
   Hopefully I can whip something up before the final release of 1.1
 * Integral attributes (dynamic, record-based fields)
   Sadly, this 1.1 design goal is not going to happen just yet.
